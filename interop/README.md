These scripts are used to compare clj9p's implementation against pre-exisiting
implementations.

You can use an interactive shell-like client with `9pclient.py 127.0.0.1:9090`

Or you can run the C-based validation script with `./c9p/validate_server.sh`

Or you can run a Python-based server with `python 9psrv.py` - Clojure client is fully operational
