# clj9p

This library is an implementation of the [9P Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9P).

Bell Labs built an entire vision around "microservices" from 1985-2004 and at the foundation is 9P.

9P, originally built to underlay the Plan9 Distributed Operating System,
is the logical conclusion of the Unix philosophy - "everything is a file."

With 9P everything *really is* a file (synthetic or real) - this includes
devices (CPUs, GPUs), kernel stacks (like the networking stack), distributed services, remote files, ... everything.
The client/consumer decides how to consume all "files" with a userland/client-based
`mount`.  That is, mount unions together all "file systems", producing a single,
resolving, file system upon which the client operates.

For more details read the [9P intro man page](https://swtch.com/plan9port/man/man1/intro.html) or look at the
[example file system](./src/cognitect/clj9p/example.clj)

**NOTE:** This repository also includes useful Netty utilities for building
networked servers and clients.

## Usage

FIXME


## TODO

 * FCall tags are random shorts, but is this really worth it?
 * Server-cleanup when a client completely disconnects (via Netty lifecycle)
