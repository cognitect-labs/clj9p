;; 9P Protocol implementation notes
;; --------------------------------

;; At the bottom level, 9P operates on calls sent to file descriptors (files, sockets, channels).
;; In this implementation, calls are constructed using Clojure maps.
;; Many benefits fall out of this choice (they can be serialized with JSON or
;; Transit, they can be stored on a file or database and read in, etc.).  When
;; a message/call is sent to the fd, it is encoded into binary and packed on a
;; buffer.  Buffers are programmed against an interface and the default
;; implementation uses a Netty ByteBuf (DirectBuffer).  Buffers are also used
;; to unpack calls/messages and turn them back into maps.

;; 9P has two types of messages: T-Messages and R-Messages.
;; From the RFC/Intro:
;;  The Plan 9 File Protocol, 9P, is used for messages between clients and servers.
;;  A client transmits *requests* (T-messages) to a server, which subsequently returns *replies* (R-messages) to the client.
;;  The combined acts of transmitting (receiving) a request of a particular type, and receiving (transmitting) its reply
;;    is called a transaction of that type.
;;  Each message consists of a sequence of bytes. Two-, four-, and eight-byte fields
;;  hold unsigned integers represented in little-endian order  (least significant byte first).
;;  Data items of larger or variable lengths are represented by a two-byte field specifying a count, n, followed by n bytes of data.
;;  Text strings are represented this way, with the text itself stored as a UTF-8 encoded sequence of Unicode characters.
;;  Text strings in 9P messages are not NUL-terminated: n counts the bytes of UTF-8 data, which include no final zero byte.
;;  The NUL character is illegal in all text strings in 9P, and is therefore excluded from file names, user names, and so on.
;;  Messages are transported in byte form to allow for machine independence.
